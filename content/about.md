I'm a Haskell and Emacs enthusiast with a very small mechanical keyboard hobby. Once upon a time, I studied physics at Columbia. Currently I'm studying Music Technology at NYU with [Brian McFee](https:www.bmcfee.github.io) and work at [Lantern](https://getlantern.org/en%5FUS/index.html). In my other life, I'm a violinist and conductor, but you can find out all about that on my [other website](https://www.josephmorag.com/).
