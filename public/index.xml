While trawling hackerrank in order to procrastinate doing &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; work, I came across &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/tree-manager/problem&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; problem in the Functional Programming section. It has you perform various incremental operations on a rose tree, such as inserting and deleting nodes and visiting adjacent nodes in the tree. In the spirit of sticking with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.simplehaskell.org/&#34;&gt;Simple Haskell&lt;/a&gt;, our first attempt at the problem will use only one benign language extension and two imports.

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a Haskell and Emacs enthusiast with a very small mechanical keyboard hobby. Once upon a time, I studied physics at Columbia. Currently I&amp;rsquo;m studying Music Technology at NYU with Brian McFee and work at Lantern. In my other life, I&amp;rsquo;m a violinist and conductor, but you can find out all about that on my other website.</description>

      <description>The world is in shambles, with Italy on total lockdown and New York City surely to follow suit in the next few days. With the prospect of working from home for the foreseeable future on the horizon, what better time to hunker down and finally start that blog that I&amp;rsquo;ve been putting off writing for forever!?</description>
